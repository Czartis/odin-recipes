hey this is my first project. thanks odin for all your help! 

Things i used building this html only website is this: links and images, lists ordered and unordened.
What i have made is simple recipe site html only by adding headings and subheadings linked images and file paths and created a step by step guide on how to prepare it!


It was very fun although this whas not very hard, learned alot in this first project.
